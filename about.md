Dead Pixel Sec was started in March 2019 as a community that developed around The Blind Hacker and his journey as a visually impaired infosec professional. Dead Pixel Sec began as a CTF (Capture the Flag) team on discord that has grown into a full collaborative community that, at its core, about sharing experiences, knowledge, and resources to help everyone learn and be the best they can be. 

Members range in experience from beginner to professional and bring a bredth of knowledge whether it is from a hobbyist perspective, development, red team, blue team, system administration, or even project management.

We are a group of Infosec enthusiasts who have a passion for learning and helping others as well as getting into mischief.  Several members of our group stream on podcasts or twitch as well.  Be sure to look us up!

A few weeks back [@Mubix](https://twitter.com/mubix) asked me to co stream [@MidAtlanticCCD](https://twitter.com/MidAtlanticCCDC) with [@spikygeek](https://twitter.com/spikygeek). I was honored, and of course accepted. It was an amazing oppertunity.

I got all the gear together and ready to go. We were set to stream Twitch. I got my cameras, microphones, cables, docking stations, got it all set up and we streamed, the whole thing, Day 1, Day 2 and the award ceremony. It was great. The students were fantastic, smart, and all-around awesome competitors. They defended the systems from some of the top hackers around, but in the end chaos broke lose.

The theme of the 2019 MACCDC was Space Force. It was a cool theme.

The teams that competed were.
Delaware Tech 
Drexel University   
Liberty University 
Millersville University 
University of Maryland, Baltimore County
University Virginia 
Virginia Commonwealth University 
West Virginia University

The scores were close, the game was close, it was intense!!! The stream is available right now on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/maccdc). After some post processing I will send them over to MACCDC and they will upload them to YouTube. 

In the end UVA took the win. The scoreboard told a different story, but in the end the total scores left UVA as the winners. Good luck at nationals! Bring home the trophy for the Mid-Atlantic.
